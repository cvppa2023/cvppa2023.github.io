This workshop will showcase the challenges raised by working on computer vision for plant phenotyping and agriculture. Workshop goals include demonstrating the state-of-the-art, identifying key unsolved problems, and introducing computer scientists with an interest in plant phenotyping to the field. Effective plant phenotyping is urgently needed to support the sustainability of our planet and its inhabitants: having strong community structures and computer vision scientists enter this field is more crucial now than ever.

This half-day workshop will be held in the afternoon of October 02, 2023 at [ICCV 2023](http://iccv2023.thecvf.com/), the International Conference on Computer Vision, which runs from October 02-06, 2023. 

The workshop will have paper tracks and challenges.

Paper submission deadline: July 21, 2023
