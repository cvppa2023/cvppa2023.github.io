We anticipate that the program will contain sessions for the two data challenges, oral presentations of accepted papers, and a poster session. We will also have one or two invited speakers covering a range of topics in computer vision for plant phenotyping.

**Update 7th September:** We are putting the finisihing touches on the programme and will be sending this out this week - thanks for your patience!
