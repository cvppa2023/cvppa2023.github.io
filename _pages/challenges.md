## Hierarchical Panoptic Segmentation of Crops and Weeds

In this challenge, one has to provide a hierarchical panoptic segmentation of sugar beets and weeds. 
More specifically, methods have to predict a semantic segmentation of sugar beets and weeds, but also an instance segmentation of crops and instance segmentation of the leaves. Thus, it is possible to get phenotypic information of the whole crop but also more fine-grained information.
