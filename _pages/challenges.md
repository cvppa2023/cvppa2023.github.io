This year, we are running the following challenges:

- [Hierarchical Panoptic Segmentation of Crops and Weeds](#hierarchical-panoptic-segmentation-of-crops-and-weeds)
- [Deep Nutrient Deficiency - Dikopshof - Winter Wheat and Winter Rye](#deep-nutrient-deficiency---dikopshof---winter-wheat-and-winter-rye)

There will be a part of the workshop, where we announce 
the winners and plan to award a certificate for winning 
entries that provide a short description of their 
technical approach by a short technical report.

Please feel free to participate to these challenges and submit your solutions as an extended abstract or full paper. Visit the [Call for Papers page](/cfp) for further details.   [Valerio Giuffrida](http://www.valeriogiuffrida.academy) is the challenges lead; [contact](mailto:V.Giuffrida@napier.ac.uk) with questions or concerns. Please also contact the competition organizers with 
specific questions regarding the competition.

## Hierarchical Panoptic Segmentation of Crops and Weeds

In this challenge, one has to provide a hierarchical panoptic segmentation of sugar beets and weeds. 
More specifically, methods have to predict a semantic segmentation of sugar beets and weeds, but also an instance segmentation of crops and instance segmentation of the leaves. Thus, it is possible to get phenotypic information of the whole crop but also more fine-grained information.

## Deep Nutrient Deficiency - Dikopshof - Winter Wheat and Winter Rye

In this challenge, we provide an image dataset of winter wheat and winter rye, where the task is to perform image classification to determine fertilizer treatments and consequently a solution to recognize nutrient deficiencies.
