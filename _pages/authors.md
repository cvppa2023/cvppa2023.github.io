We follow closely the ICCV 2021 [formatting and submission guidelines](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/node/4#submission-guidelines), however using a different webpage on the CMT paper submission site. The peer-review process is double blind, as usual, in order to ensure unbiased reviews and highest paper quality.

Paper submission and registration are handled on [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CVPPP2019). Paper registration is performed by registering as a user with CMT and entering a paper title and abstract. This will result in the allocation of a “paper ID”, which indicates registration is completed and should be used in preparation of the review copy. You will be able to make edits and upload new paper drafts until the final deadline. Submitted papers should be prepared according to the published specification for formatting and style. Please be sure to read both the formatting instructions and policies before submission. Some common questions about submission are addressed in the ICCV [FAQs](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/node/4#authors-faqs).

Please register and submit at CMT *Link To Be Announced*.

## Formatting your paper for review.
Both full papers and one-page extended abstracts should be submitted using the template for ICCV 2021.  Papers submitted for review must be anonymous in order to enable double-blind review, and instead include the paper ID as allocated by CMT upon registration of the paper. The addition of line numbers (automatic in the LaTeX template) should be included, in order to facilitate the review process. If in doubt, please refer to [http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/node/4#submission-guidelines](http://iccv2021.thecvf.com/node/4#submission-guidelines).

### Full papers:
The length should not exceed 8 pages excluding the references. Any appendices must precede the reference list. This length is sometimes called 8 + n.

### Extended abstracts: 
The length should not exceed 2 page excluding the references, ie. 2 + n.  These papers will appear (after peer review) on the CVPPA website, but will not be part of ICCV proceedings. The same double blind rules apply, see above.  As a guide, extended abstracts should follow a regular paper structure, though abbreviated. This should include an introduction, a description of the work undertaken, the results, and a conclusion. Note that the instructions differed in 2019, but examples of extended abstracts from 2019 can be found [here](https://www.plant-phenotyping.org/CVPPP2019-Proceedings).

## Full paper policies.

By submitting a manuscript to CVPPA 2021, the authors guarantee that it has not been previously published (or accepted for publication) in substantially similar form. Furthermore, no full paper which contains significant overlap with the contributions of this paper is either under review at the moment of submission or will be submitted during the CVPPA 2021 review period to any of the following: another conference, a workshop, or a journal. The authors also attest that they did not submit substantially similar submissions to CVPPA 2021. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection.

## Author's responsibilities.

If there are papers that may appear to violate any of these conditions, it is the authors’ responsibility to cite these papers (preserving anonymity), argue in the body of your paper why your CVPPA 2021 paper is non trivially different from these concurrent submissions, include anonymized versions of those papers in the supplemental material.

## Final camera ready copy (CRC).

Camera-ready submission for accepted papers will be open via *CMT link To Be Announced.*  At least one author of the paper needs to be registered for the workshop. Papers for which we have no registered authors will be removed from the workshop. For each accepted full paper authors should upload:
- final camera-ready paper (in PDF format),
- optional supplementary materials (single ZIP file up to 100MB).

The name of your submission file must be of the form XXXX.pdf where XXXX is the four-digit paper ID (zero-padded if necessary). For example, if your paper ID is 24, the filename must be 0024.pdf.

## Supplementary material. 
Authors may optionally upload supplementary material, which may include:
- Videos to showcase results/demo of the proposed approach/system,
- Images and other results in addition to the ones in the paper,
- Anonymized related submissions to other conferences and journals,
- Appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential to the understanding of the submitted paper.
